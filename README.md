## The WinterTrain

The *WinterTrain* is an ongoing development aiming at realizing a simple signaling system for *model trains* inspired by 
the European Standard [ETCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System)

The project implements concepts like *train route locking* to avoid collisions between trains, *movement authority* for individual trains, *automatic train operation* and *manual train operation* via a driver panel.

The *winterTrain* is realized using [Arduino](http://arduino.cc), [JeeNode](http://jeelabs.org) and [Raspberry PI](https://www.raspberrypi.org).

Documentation including HW diagrams and photos can be found at the WinterTrain wiki (currently off-line, sorry)
